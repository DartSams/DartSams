Installation & Deployment 📦
Clone the repository and modify the content of index.html according to your requirement.
Add or remove images from varadbhogayata.github.io/assets/img/ directory as per your requirement.
I highly recommend to use Github Pages to deploy the website the EASIEST WAY.
To deploy your website, first you need to create github repository with name <your-github-username>.github.io. Please don't give any other name.
Push the generated code to the master branch of this repository.
NOTE: Make sure to set analyticsId from your Google Analytics account inside the Google Analytics script tag, if you want to use your own Google Analytics account.
